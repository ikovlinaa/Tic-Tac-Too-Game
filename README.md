Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns placing an X or an O in a square. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

To play the game, clone this repository and run the tic_tac_toe.py file. The game will start and you will be able to play against the computer.

The game is over when one player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The winning player will be displayed.

If you want to play against another player, you can do so by passing the -p flag to the tic_tac_toe.py file. For example, to play against another player on the command line, you would run the following command:

python3 main.py -p


I hope you enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
